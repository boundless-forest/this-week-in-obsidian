### 💎 Gem of the Week

[Another Quick Switcher](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher)

A power-user replacement for Obsidian’s Quick Switcher that lets you build custom search commands and tune matching/ranking. It goes beyond file switching with modes like header/in-file search, backlink/link search with context, and ripgrep-powered grep—plus live previews so you can scan notes without leaving the dialog. Try it if you bounce between a big vault and need a single “jump-to-anything” palette for files, headings, links, and full-text content.
