## Workflow

### Weekly Cycle

#### 1. Start a New Draft

At the beginning of the week (or right after publishing the previous issue):
1. Copy the template from `templates/newsletter-template.md` to `drafts/`.
2. Name it with the upcoming Tuesday's date, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-issue-XX.md`.
3. Update the Frontmatter `date` and the Title date in the file.

#### 2. Curate Content

Throughout the week, add interesting links, plugins, and news to the draft file.
- Use standard Markdown.
- Keep descriptions concise.
- Credit authors.

#### 3. Review and Polish (Monday/Tuesday)

- Proofread the content.
- Check all links.
- Ensure formatting is consistent.

#### 4. Publish (Tuesday)

1. Copy the content from the Markdown file.
2. Paste it into the Substack editor.
   - *Note: Substack handles Markdown well, but check the preview.*
3. Publish on Substack.

#### 5. Archive

1. Move the published file from `drafts/` to `archive/YYYY/`.
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub.
