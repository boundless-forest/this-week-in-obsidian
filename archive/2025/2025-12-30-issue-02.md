### 💎 Gem of the Week

This week’s Gem of the Week is [**Notebook Navigator**](https://notebooknavigator.com/), a plugin that completely levels up how you browse your vault. If you’ve ever missed the clean, dual-pane feel of apps like Apple Notes or Bear, this is exactly what you need. It swaps out the standard file explorer for a much more intuitive setup, putting your navigation tree on the left and a rich list of notes on the right, making your "second brain" feel like a polished, professional workspace
