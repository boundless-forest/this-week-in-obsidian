### 💎 Gem of the Week

[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks) — Turn your vault into a tabletop-ready bestiary by creating, managing, and viewing Dungeons & Dragons–style statblocks directly inside Obsidian. It’s a gem because it keeps crunchy RPG reference material in the
  same place you plan sessions and write notes, with clean, readable layouts. If you run campaigns from your vault (or just love worldbuilding), give it a spin and start building a single-source-of-truth bestiary.
