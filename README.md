**This Week in Obsidian** is a weekly newsletter published every Tuesday, dedicated to tracking the progress and community of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Our target audience includes Obsidian users, plugin developers, and knowledge management enthusiasts who want to stay up-to-date with the latest gems, plugins, themes, and workflows.

## Workflow

The production cycle is straightforward: we start a new draft at the beginning of the week using the CLI tool, curate content (news, plugins, tips) throughout the week, review and polish the draft on Monday or Tuesday, publish it to Substack, and finally archive the published issue using the CLI tool.

## Folder Structure

- **drafts/**: Contains the current work-in-progress newsletter issue.
- **archive/**: Stores past issues organized by year (e.g., `archive/2025/`).
- **templates/**: Holds the standard Markdown template for new issues.
