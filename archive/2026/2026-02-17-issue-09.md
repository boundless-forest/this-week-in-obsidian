### 💎 Gem of the Week

**[Typewriter Mode](https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode)**

This plugin turns Obsidian into a focused writing environment with typewriter scrolling, current-line highlighting, and dimming of unfocused text so your cursor stays centered and your attention stays put. It stands out because it pairs the classic typewriter feel with practical polish like line-length limits and restoring your last cursor position when you reopen a note. If you do long-form drafting or daily writing sessions, this is a clean way to keep your flow steady.
