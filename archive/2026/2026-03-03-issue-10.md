### 💎 Gem of the Week

**[HiNote](https://github.com/CatMuse/HiNote)** 

HiNote pulls highlights from your notes into a sidebar and lets you add comments directly to each highlight, keeping ideas attached to the exact passage. It stands out this week for its AI-assisted commenting and chat around highlights, plus one-click exports to shareable knowledge-card images or new linked notes. If you annotate heavily or turn highlights into study material, this one is worth a spin.
