### 💎 Gem of the Week

**[Markmind](https://github.com/MarkMindCkm/obsidian-markmind)**

If you love brainstorming visually (or you’re trying to untangle a gnarly project plan), Markmind turns Obsidian into a proper mind‑mapping workspace. It supports both desktop and mobile, lets you build mind maps in a lightweight “Basic” mode or a more powerful “Rich” mode, and can flip the same content into outline or table views when you want something more structured. It’s a great pick if you want to stay in your vault while planning, organizing, and even annotating PDFs without bouncing between apps.
