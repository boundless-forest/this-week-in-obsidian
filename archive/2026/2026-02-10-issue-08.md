### 💎 Gem of the Week

**[Chronos Timeline](https://github.com/clairefro/obsidian-plugin-chronos)** 

Chronos turns a simple `chronos` code block into an interactive, zoomable timeline right inside Obsidian—great for histories, project milestones, and life logs. What makes it shine is that the data stays plain-text and portable, but you can still generate timelines from highlighted text with AI, link items back to notes, and even compile a combined timeline from a folder. If your vault has lots of dated notes and you want a fast “what happened when?” view without leaving Markdown, give Chronos a try.
